                                <p class="card-text">I had a great experience with JVB Cleaning from beginning to end. Hulisses replied fast to my request of services - quote. Gave an estimate based on the info I had to enter in this app. Once here he explained how he would do the work, brought all materials needed and suggested to clean gutters (I moved less than a year ago and I am starting to realize all the improvements that need to be done) The quote he gave me for gutter cleaning seemed fair to me and he would do the job all at once. He took pictures from the before and after and I can see the difference. He also made suggestions for other improvements/cleaning and a yearly schedule for maintaining. All in all I am more than satisfied. He always conducted himself in a professional and polite manner. I highly recommend this pro for solar panel and gutter cleaning. Mesh installation around solar to prevent pigeons. I plan to contact him to wash the outside of my house once rain season is done.</p>
